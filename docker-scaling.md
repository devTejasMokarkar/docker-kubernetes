Awesome! 🔥  
You're thinking **perfectly** — first **master it locally**, then move to EC2/cloud. 🧠⚡

Let's start with a **clean simple local setup**:  
**Docker + Spring Boot + Scaling with Docker Swarm** on your PC/laptop.

I'll guide you step-by-step 🛠️

---

# 🚀 Step 1: Install Docker on Your Local System
- Go to [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Download **Docker Desktop** for your OS (Windows / Mac / Linux)
- Install and start Docker
- Test it:
```bash
docker --version
```
✅ If you see Docker version, you're good!

---

# 🚀 Step 2: Create a Simple Spring Boot App

If you already have a Spring app, great!  
Otherwise, let's make a small sample.

Quickstart (using [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)):
- Project: **Maven**
- Language: **Java**
- Spring Boot: **latest stable**
- Dependencies:
  - Spring Web

Download, unzip, open in your IDE (IntelliJ/Eclipse/VS Code).

Then create a simple REST Controller:

```java
@RestController
public class HelloController {
    
    @GetMapping("/")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello from Dockerized Spring Boot!";
    }
}
```

✅ Now your app is ready.

---

# 🚀 Step 3: Create a Dockerfile

In your Spring project root, create a file named **`Dockerfile`**:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official OpenJDK runtime as a parent image
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

# Set the working directory inside container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the jar file into container
COPY target/*.jar app.jar

# Run the jar file
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

✅ This tells Docker how to build your Spring app image.

---

# 🚀 Step 4: Build and Run Docker Image Locally

First, **build** your project (generate the JAR):

```bash
./mvnw clean package
```
(or `mvn clean package`)

You should get a **`target/yourapp.jar`** file.

Now **build the Docker image**:

```bash
docker build -t my-spring-app .
```

Run it locally:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 my-spring-app
```

✅ Now go to your browser → `http://localhost:8080` → You should see **"Hello from Dockerized Spring Boot!"**

---

# 🚀 Step 5: Enable Docker Swarm Locally

Turn on Swarm Mode (only once):

```bash
docker swarm init
```

✅ Your machine is now a "single-node Swarm cluster"!

---

# 🚀 Step 6: Deploy the app with Swarm

Create a Swarm service:

```bash
docker service create --name springapp -p 8080:8080 my-spring-app
```

✅ Your app is now running as a **Swarm service**!

---

# 🚀 Step 7: Scale the App

Want multiple instances (replicas)? Easy:

```bash
docker service scale springapp=3
```

✅ Now there are **3 containers** running behind 8080 port — load balanced internally by Docker.

Check running services:

```bash
docker service ls
```

Check running containers:

```bash
docker service ps springapp
```
