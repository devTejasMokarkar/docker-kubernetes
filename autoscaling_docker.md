Below is a professional markdown document that summarizes the successful Docker commands you executed along with concise explanations for each step. You can save this as a “COMMANDS.md” (or similar) file for future reference.

# Docker Commands Reference Document

This document summarizes the Docker commands used for deploying stacks, managing overlay networks, and running an autoscaler container. Each command is accompanied by a brief explanation.

---

## Table of Contents

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Network Management](#network-management)
- [Stack Deployment](#stack-deployment)
- [Deploying the Autoscaler](#deploying-the-autoscaler)
- [Monitoring and Logs](#monitoring-and-logs)
- [Cleanup and Troubleshooting](#cleanup-and-troubleshooting)

---

## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine and Docker Swarm initialized.
- Docker Compose files:
  - `prometheus-stack.yml`
  - `docker-compose.yml`
- Autoscaler configuration file: `autoscaler.yml`
- Required Docker images available on your local system or accessible from a registry:
  - `sahajsoft/docker-swarm-service-autoscaler`
  - Prometheus image (e.g., `prom/prometheus:latest`)

---

## Network Management

### 1. List all Docker Networks

Lists all available Docker networks to verify existing setups.

```bash
docker network ls
```

### 2. Inspect an Existing Network

Check detailed information about the overlay network named `monitoring-net`.

```bash
docker network inspect monitoring-net
```

### 3. Remove and Recreate the Overlay Network

If you need to recreate the `monitoring-net` as an attachable network, remove the existing network (if no service is using it) and create a new one.  
**Note:** In the provided session, removal was blocked because the network was in use. Ensure no services are attached before removing.

```bash
docker network rm monitoring-net
docker network create --driver overlay --attachable monitoring-net
```

*Successful recreation returned a new network ID (e.g., `rpbeuj4vibr8faenllsp6i8z0`).*

---

## Stack Deployment

### 1. Deploy the Prometheus Stack

This command deploys the Prometheus stack using the configuration in `prometheus-stack.yml`.  
It creates or updates the service `monitoring_prometheus`.

```bash
docker stack deploy -c prometheus-stack.yml monitoring
```

### 2. Deploy the Application Stack

Deploy your application stack using the configuration in `docker-compose.yml`.  
The service is updated/created (in the log, `my-stack_my-app` was updated).

```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml my-stack
```

---

## Deploying the Autoscaler

### 1. Remove Existing Autoscaler Container (if necessary)

If there is a naming conflict with an existing container named `autoscaler`, remove it first:

```bash
docker rm autoscaler
```

### 2. Deploy the Autoscaler Container

Run the autoscaler container in detached mode with the Docker socket and configuration volume mounted.  
Make sure to use the recreated `monitoring-net` network (which must be defined as attachable).

```bash
docker run -d --name autoscaler \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v $(pwd)/autoscaler.yml:/etc/docker-swarm-service-autoscaler/autoscaler.yml \
  --network monitoring-net \
  sahajsoft/docker-swarm-service-autoscaler \
  /etc/docker-swarm-service-autoscaler/autoscaler.yml --log-level=DEBUG
```

*This command successfully launches the autoscaler container, as seen in the log output with a container ID (e.g., `4a4f6ae16f43...`).*

---

## Monitoring and Logs

### 1. List Running Containers

To verify that the autoscaler and other services are running:

```bash
docker ps
```

### 2. Follow Logs for the Autoscaler Container

View real-time logs from the autoscaler container to monitor its operation and debug if needed:

```bash
docker logs -f autoscaler
```

---

## Cleanup and Troubleshooting

- **Container Name Conflicts:**  
  If you encounter errors indicating that the container name `/autoscaler` is already in use, use the removal command:  
  ```bash
  docker rm autoscaler
  ```
  This frees up the name so the container can be redeployed.

- **Network Attachment Issues:**  
  The error “network monitoring-net not manually attachable” indicates that the network is not configured as attachable. Ensure you create the network with the `--attachable` flag when required.

- **Service Dependencies:**  
  When updating stacks, verify which services depend on each network before attempting removal to avoid precondition errors.

---

## Final Notes

Ensure that each deployment command is executed in a proper sequence and that no services are left interfering (especially for network attachment) during the process. This document can be updated as you modify your configuration files or Docker setup.

Happy Dockerizing!
